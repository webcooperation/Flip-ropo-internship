      "Text: During the first half it looked like it might be going to be the same old story for City and hard luck for Inter Milan who played on the nervousness of Man City and the clever game plan nearly worked but just a few weaknesses and lack of quality in certain areas cost them dear. Manchester City in the grander scheme of things deserved to win the cup for the first time because they have been such a good team over the past few seasons and got due reward but might need to improve a little bit more to win it again and that would be equally special because a second Champions League win marks a big increase in credibility and prestige.\n",

      "Text: Headlines today should read &quot;MAN CITY FINALLY BUY FOOTBALL&quot;. City have access to resources that no other club has. This is not team building it is simply financial doping. City are the second best club in Manchester and were around the level of Birmingham before the wheelbarrows of money arrived. Champions of Europe? Treble Winners? Doesn&#39;t happen without them warping the game with money. When City were on TV last season I didn&#39;t watch, because the outcome was inevitable. They never lost a game in the Champions League either. Football has been compromised and eventually other fans will shun the game if this financial doping continues. Let&#39;s see the smallest club in Manchester keep Sky and BT TV afloat with their subscriptions......<br><br>Never happen.\n",
